      <title>Some thoughts on mathematics (the Beilinson conjecture)</title>

      <description>I wrote this article because I was reading about algebraic number theory and I stumbled across a totally unexpectedly amazing conjecture: certain special values of the Riemann zeta function (at odd integers) are related to the higher $K$-groups from algebraic $K$-theory. $$ \zeta(2k-1)\equiv R_{2k}\bmod{\mathbb{Q}^*}. $$ These insights were summarized within the Beilinson conjecture.
I was utterly impressed by this deep and profound connection between number theory and topology.
Indeed, I had the incorrect belief that analytic number theory and algebraic topology are almost completely unrelated.</description>

      <title>Localization of smooth functions</title>

      <description>In this note we prove a rather surprising fact: the ring of smooth functions on an open subset $U$ of a manifold $M$ is the same as localizing the ring of smooth functions on $M$ at the multiplicative system of smooth functions that do not vanish on $U$. As far as I know, this is a known result, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it any literature that rigorously proves this fact, so I decided to write it down myself.</description>

      <title>Tensoriality</title>

      <description>We introduce an important concept called tensoriality, which you may also recognize as $C^{\infty}(M)$-linearity. It is a very common argument in tensor analysis. I have made this note as self-contained as possible.
$\boldsymbol{\sf Definition\textsf{}.}$	Let $V$ be a finite dimensional real vector space. We define $$ T^{(k,l)}V:=\underbrace{V\otimes\cdots\otimes V}_k\otimes \underbrace{V^\ast\otimes\cdots\otimes V^\ast}_{l}. $$ Similarly, if $E\to M$ is a vector bundle, we define $$ T^{(k,l)}E:=\underbrace{E\otimes\cdots\otimes E}_k\otimes \underbrace{E^\ast\otimes\cdots\otimes E^\ast}_{l}. $$
$\boldsymbol{\sf Definition\textsf{}.}$	A tensor field on a manifold $M$ is a section of $T^{(k,l)}TM$ for some $(k,l)$.</description>

      <title>Milnor&#39;s Exercise</title>

      <description>The following interesting theorem is sometimes called &amp;ldquo;Milnor&amp;rsquo;s exercise.&amp;rdquo; This was indeed an exercise in the book Characteristic Classes by Milnor and Stasheff, exercise 1-C. Of course, Milnor did not provide a solution himself, and it seems that the result was first proved by Pursell.
$\boldsymbol{\sf Theorem\textsf{}.}$	Let $M$ be a smooth manifold (with or without boundary). Suppose $\mathcal{F}=C^{\infty}(M)$ is the $\mathbb{R}$-algebra of smooth real-valued functions on $M$. Then for any $\mathbb{R}$-algebra homomorphism $p:\mathcal F\to\mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique $x\in X$ such that $$ p(f)=f(x),\quad \forall f\in\mathcal F, $$ i.</description>

      <title>Milnor&#39;s Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>

      <description>I came across the following interesting proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. The argument is due to Milnor and can be found in his book Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint. The proof uses differential topology and some very elementary complex analysis. In particular, it does not use Liouville&amp;rsquo;s theorem, which is one of the most common ways to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra.

      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Zhuo. This is a test post. $$ \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)=(-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{q-1}{2}}. $$</description>
