Here I will post various notes or papers that I've written.

* (Link to come) Some [<span style="color:blue">notes</span>]() on representation theory. This was created with four other participants of the ICLUE Summer 2022 program on representation theory and combinatorics.

* The expository [<span style="color:blue">paper</span>](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2023/REUPapers/Zhang,Zhuo.pdf) I wrote in the UChicago Summer 2023 Math REU Program. The topic is bordism homology.

* (Link to come) Some [<span style="color:blue">notes</span>]() on smooth manifolds. This is my personal note for the graduate course Math 518 *Differentiable Manifolds* at UIUC in Fall 2023.
