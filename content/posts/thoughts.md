I wrote this article because I was reading about algebraic number theory and I stumbled across a totally unexpectedly amazing [conjecture](https://math.mit.edu/juvitop/old/notes/2015_Fall/NotesF6.pdf): certain special values of the Riemann zeta function (at odd integers) are related to the higher $K$-groups from algebraic $K$-theory.
$$
\zeta(2k-1)\equiv R_{2k}\bmod{\mathbb{Q}^*}.
$$
These insights were summarized within the Beilinson conjecture.

***I was utterly impressed by this deep and profound connection between number theory and topology.***

Indeed, I had the incorrect belief that analytic number theory and algebraic topology are almost completely unrelated. My reasoning was simple: Analytic number theory involves a lot of analysis: bounding error terms, manipulating sums and integrals, investigating zeros of meromorphic functions; on the other hand, algebraic topology has a completely different flavor; it involves lots of diagram chasing, investigating homotopy groups of spheres, and many many algebraic techniques... At first glance, they indeed have very little in common. However, as the conjecture suggests, there are an abundance of deep connections between the two areas.

Currently the conjecture seems completely out of reach. I suspect that it would take decades for mathematicians to develop the tools to even approach the conjecture, due to the fact that this conjecture lies at the intersection of almost all areas of mathematics (analysis, topology, number theory, algebra ...) and very few people can excel at all of them.

While I am not able to fully understand, let alone prove, this conjecture, there is one lesson that we all need to learn from this. That is, any two areas of math are closely related. If we cannot see the connection, that is either because not enough math has been developed or because of our lack of imagination.
