Hello! I'm Zhuo. This is my personal website, where I will record and organize some of my mathematical stuffs.
$$
\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)=(-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{q-1}{2}}.
$$
In particular I will share my notes, which I hope you will find helpful. I would also love to share my thoughts on life, music, and other non-academic things.
