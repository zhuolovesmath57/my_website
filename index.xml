      <description>The following interesting theorem is sometimes called &amp;ldquo;Milnor&amp;rsquo;s exercise.&amp;rdquo; Of couse, Milnor did not provide a solution himself, and it seems that the result was first proved by Pursell.
$\boldsymbol{\sf Theorem\textsf{}.}$	Let $M$ be a smooth manifold (with or without boundary). Suppose $\mathcal{F}=C^{\infty}(M)$ is the $\mathbb{R}$-algebra of smooth real-valued functions on $M$. Then for any $\mathbb{R}$-algebra homomorphism $p:\mathcal F\to\mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique $x\in X$ such that $$ p(f)=f(x),\quad \forall f\in\mathcal F, $$ i.</description>

      <title>Milnor&#39;s Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>

      <description>I came across the following interesting proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. The argument is due to Milnor and can be found in his book Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint. The proof uses differential topology and some very elementary complex analysis. In particular, it does not use Liouville&amp;rsquo;s theorem, which is one of the most common ways to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra.

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Zhuo Zhang, a third year undergraduate student studying math at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. Here is my CV.
I am broadly interested in many areas of math, but I am particularly interested in number theory and topology.
This is my personal website, where I will record and organize some of my mathematical stuffs. I will share my notes and other writings, which you can access by following the various links on the top of the webpage.</description>

      <description>Here I will post various notes or papers that I&amp;rsquo;ve written.
(Link to come) Some notes on representation theory. This was created with four other participants of the ICLUE Summer 2022 program on representation theory and combinatorics.
The expository paper I wrote in the UChicago Summer 2023 Math REU Program. The topic is bordism homology.
(Link to come) Some notes on smooth manifolds. This is my personal note for the graduate course Math 518 Differentiable Manifolds at UIUC in Fall 2023.</description>
